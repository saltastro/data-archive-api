  title: SAAO/SALT data archive API
  version: "0.1.0"
  description: >
    An API for programmatically accessing the SAAO/SALT archive of telescope observation
    data.
    <br><br>
    The API allows you to request metadata for all observations in the archive, as well
    as to view more in-depth details and to request the data files if the data is public
    or if you are an investigator for the observation.
    <br><br>
    A typical workflow would be to first use `POST /observations/search` to define a search
    for a set of search parameters. This returns a search id that you can then use as a query
    parameter in a `GET /observations` request.
    <br><br>
    If you are the investigator, you may get more details of an observation file by means of
    a `GET /files/{file_id}` request. These details include the FITS headers and a thumbnail
    image.
    <br><br>
    You may request data files using `POST /data-requests`. You will receive an email
    notification once all the requested data is available. You may also use `GET
    /data-requests` to check the status of your requests.
    <br><br>
    Files can be downloaded using `GET /files/{file_id}` (for a single file) or `GET
    observations/{observation_id}` (for all files related to the observation) or `GET
    data-requests/{request_id}` once they have been made available.
    <br><br>
    Registration is possible by using `POST /users`. In order to be identifiable as an
    investigator (and hence have full access to your observational data), you need to link
    your user accounts for the telescopes concerned. You may use `POST /linked-accounts` for
    doing this. It is possible to link multiple accopunts for a telescope.

      summary: Define an observation search
      description: >
        Define a search for observations. The search is not executed, but an identifier
        for it is returned. You may use this identifier as query parameter in a `GET
        /observations` request to carry out the search and get its results.
        <br><br>
        You may supply a set of search parameters. Each of these must have a keyword,
        a value and an operator such as `=`, `<` or `LIKE`. An expression `a LIKE b` is
        true if `b` is a substring of `a`. (Note to SQL users: Do not wrap the comparison
        value `b` in % signs, e.g. use `NGC` rather than `%NGC%`.)

        search is executed and its results are returned. Otherwise the latest observations are
        returned. You may limit the number of observations returned with the `limit`

        will not be larger than the number specified in the `limit` parameter.

        An observation has a name and list of FITS file objects, which in turn include a
        filename and metadata. In SALT terms, an observation is a block. The FITS files
        include all data taken as part of the observation, including acquisition and
        calibration files, unless you explicitly select the type of data to include.
